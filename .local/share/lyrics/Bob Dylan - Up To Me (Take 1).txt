Everything went from bad to worse
Money never changed a thing
Death kept followin′, trackin' us downAt least I heard your bluebird sing

Now somebody′s got to show their hand
Time is an enemy
I know you're long gone
I guess it must be up to me

If I'd thought about it I never would′ve done it
I guess I would′ve let it slide
If I'd paid attention to what others were thinkin′
The heart inside me would've died

I was just too stubborn to ever be governed
By enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the risin′ star
I guess it was up to me

Oh, the union central is pullin' out
And the orchids are in bloom
I′ve only got me one good shirt left
And it smells of stale perfume

In 14 months I've only smiled once
And I didn't do it consciously
Somebody′s got to find your trail
I guess it must be up to me

It was like a revelation
When you betrayed me with your touch
I′d just about convinced myself
That nothin' had changed that much

The old rounder in the iron mask
Slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart
He said it was up to me

Well, I watched you slowly disappear
Down into the officers′ club
I would've followed you in the door
But I didn′t have a ticket stub

So I waited all night 'til the break of day
Hopin′ one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge
I knew it was up to me

Well, the only decent thing I did
When I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall
Near the cage where I used to work

Was I a fool or not to try
To protect your real identity?
You looked a little burned out, my friend
I thought it might be up to me

Well, I met somebody face to face
And I had to remove my hat
She's everything I need in love
But I can't be swayed by that

It frightens me, the awful truth
Of how sweet life can be
But she ain′t a-gonna make a move
I guess it must be up to me

We heard the sermon on the mount
And I knew it was too complex
It didn′t amount to anything more
Than what the broken glass reflects

When you bite off more than you can chew
You pay the penalty
Somebody's got to tell the tale
I guess it must be up to me

Well, Dupree came in pimpin′ tonight
To the Thunderbird cafe
Crystal wanted to talk to him
I had to look the other way

Well, I just can't rest without your love
I need your company
But you ain′t a-gonna cross the line
I guess it must be up to me

There's a note left in the bottle
You can give it to Estelle
She′s the one you been wonderin' about
But there's really nothin′ much to tell

We both heard voices for a while
Now the rest is history
Somebody′s got to cry some tears
I guess it must be up to me

So go on, boys, and play your hands
Life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat
Say you don't have all that much time

And the girl with me behind the shades
She ain′t my property
One of us has got to hit the road
I guess it must be up to me

And if we never meet again
Baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you
That old-time melody

And the harmonica around my neck
I blew it for you free
No one else could play that tune
You know it was up to me
