Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Midnight, I′m wound up tight
Slowly comin' down in the daytime
I been lyin′ low from work,
Hanging' over from the hurt from you, babe
But I'm gonna suffer through the strain ′til I get a
Better thing with you, Darlin′, me and you

So hard to see so far ahead
When I can't seem to drag myself out of bed
Gotta find me a good man... a good man... good man... yeah

You better stop and think about what you′re saying
I was seriously dedicated this game of playin'
You made ten thousand promises you couldn′t keep
I forgave you when you lied, pleaded and weeped
I put up with your disrespect and neglect
And what an experience I'll never forget

′Til now everything I did was wrong
I'm sorry baby
Today we're free, but we live alone
Gotta find me a good woman... good woman... good woman... yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

It was twelve o′clock in the midnight hour
I heard the door slam and then the shower
When I got up, you were already gone
I slipped and fell in the water you left on

Gotta find a good woman
Gotta find a good man
Gotta find a good woman
Gotta find a good man
Gotta find a good woman
Gotta find a good man
Gotta find a good woman
Gotta find a good man

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
