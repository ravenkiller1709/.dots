I was in a daze, movin′ in the wrong direction
Feelin' that I′d always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face on the edge of my horizonWhisperin' that I wasn't the only one, the lonely one

One chance intervention
See what it can signify
The slightest mis-apprehension, baby
We′d have passed each other by

When I heard your sweet voice callin′
Saw your light come shinin' through
I couldn′t stop my heart from turning
Churnin' out my love for you

′Cause I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction
Feelin′ that I'd always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon
Whisperin' that I wasn′t the only one, the lonely one

True love or perfection
It seems like it′s overdue
Then just when you least expect it
It comes sneakin' up on you

And when I thought that I was dreaming
Felt your body close to mine
Now love takes on a different meaning
Together till the end of time

I was in a daze, movin′ in the wrong direction
Feelin' that I′d always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face through the web of my confusion
Whisperin' that I was not the only one, the lonely one
Lonely one, alone, baby

Not the only one, listen baby
Not the only one
I′m the only one
I'm the only, only one, baby

I'm the only one, listen baby
I′m the only one
I′m the only one
I'm the only one

Lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely
Lonely
