When the rain is blowin′ in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embraceTo make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I′ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I′d go crawlin′ down the avenue
No, there's nothin′ that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

Though storms are raging on the rollin′ sea
And on the highway of regrets
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothin′ like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
