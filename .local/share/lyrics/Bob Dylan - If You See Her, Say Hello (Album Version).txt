If you see her, say hello
She might be in Tangier
She left here last early springIs living there I hear

Say for me that I′m all right
Though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her
Don′t tell her it isn't so

We had a falling-out
Like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night
It still brings me a chill

And though our separation
It pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me
We've never been apart

If you get close to her
Kiss her once for me
I always have respected her
For doing what she did and getting free

Oh, whatever makes her happy
I won′t stand in the way
Oh, the bitter taste still lingers on
From the night I tried to make her stay

I see a lot of people
As I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there
As I go from town to town

And I′ve never gotten used to it
I've just learned to turn it off
Either I′m too sensitive
Or else I'm getting soft

Sundown yellow moon
I replay the past
I know every scene by heart
They all went by so fast

If she′s passing back this way
I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up
If she′s got the time
