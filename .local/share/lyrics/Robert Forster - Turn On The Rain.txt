Turn On The Rain

from the 2015 album 'Songs To Play'.

Don't stare at the heavens
For guidance or reason or even rhyme
Don't stare at the heavens
Hoping to find the movement of time
It's not on my mind
But I know that there's someone
To turn on the rain.

We walked down through the city
We were happy and it was hot in the shade
And to make it a perfect day
I knew there was someone
To turn on the rain.

Turn on the rain
Come on let it pour
As we huddled in the shade
Turn on the rain.

Turn on the rain
Turn on the rain
Make it loud and make it plain
Oh yeah, please turn on the rain.
