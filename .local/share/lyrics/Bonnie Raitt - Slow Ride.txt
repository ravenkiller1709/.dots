Feels like nothin happens fast enough
Well maybe I just want too much
But when something′s wrong between us, BabyNothin feels right.

I think it's time we cleared the air
Take a long drive far away somewhere
Tell me everything you feel inside
We got nothin but time.

Slide over, Baby
Here by my side
I wanna take you on a Slow Ride
On a Slow Ride.

Your history shows on your face
Yeah, you′ve been hurt you've been betrayed
Now we can't change the past, but we can
Leave it behind.

We′ll forget about tomorrow, Baby
We′ll just steal away into the night
And we'll just be two shadows, Darlin
In the dashboard light.

Slide over, Baby
Here by my side
I wanna take you on a Slow Ride
On a Slow Ride
