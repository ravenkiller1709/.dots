People are talking, talkin′ 'bout people
I hear them whisper you won′t believe it
They think we're lovers kept under coverI'll just ignore it, but they keep sayin′ we

Laugh just a little too loud (a little too loud)
Stand just a little too close (too close)
We stare just a little too long
Maybe they′re seeing something we don't darling

Let′s give 'em something to talk about (something to talk about)
Let′s give 'em something to talk about (something to talk about)
Let′s give 'em something to talk about
How about love

I feel so foolish, I never noticed
You'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
It took a rumor to make me wonder
Now I′m convinced that I′m going under

I'm thinking ′bout you every day (every day)
Dreaming 'bout you every night (every night)
I′m hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, then let's really show it darling

Let′s give 'em something to talk about (something to talk about)
A little mystery to figure out (something to talk about)
Let's give ′em something to talk about
How about love, love, love

Let′s give 'em something to talk about baby
A little mystery to figure out
Let′s give 'em something to talk about
How about love (love, love, love)

Ooh, listen to ′em baby (something to talk about)
A little mystery won't hurt (something to talk about)
A little something to talk about
How about my love, love, love, love

Love, ooh-ooh

How about love, love, love
How ′bout it baby
How about it drives us mad
How about love, love
