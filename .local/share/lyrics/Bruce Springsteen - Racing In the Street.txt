"Racing In The Street '78"
(Alternate 1978 Version)

Got a '32 Ford, she's a 318
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and we shut 'em down
Tonight tonight the strips just right
I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats
Well come on out around the world
We're goin' racin' in the street

Well we take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
And when the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
From the back roads to the turnpike gates
Well now some guys they do it for the money
Other guys do it cause they don't know what else they can do
Well and they just hang around in an empty home
Waking up in a world that somebody else owns
And tonight tonight the strip's just right
I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
Well now summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street

Well I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A
And I blew that Camaro off my back
And I stole that little girl away
But now there wrinkles round my baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
And when I come home the house is dark
She sighs "hey baby did you make it all right?"
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
Oh but honey your pretty dress is torn
She stared off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the blown-off strangers and hot rod angels
Stumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
Well come on out the time is right
We're goin' racin' in the street
