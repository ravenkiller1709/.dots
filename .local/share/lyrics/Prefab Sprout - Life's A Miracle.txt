Say, what you doing sleeping?
Hey, half the day is gone
Get a move on
Life′s a miracle
Let me tell you why
If you look above you
There are no more stars
Like this one in the sky

Life's a miracle
We gotta make the most
Of the passing moment
Gotta do our best
There′ll be time enough to rest

Gotta do our best
There'll be time enough to rest

Tell someone you them
There's always a way
And if the dead could speak
I know what they would say o ytou and me
Don′t waste another day

Show someone you love them
Don′t be scared to care
And if they fall into your arms
You'll be surprised to find
The weight that you can bear
Because

Life′s a miracle
We gotta do our best
Before it's time to rest
Life′s a miracle
It's a Summer′s day
It's a passing moment
Enjoy the sky
Be a brilliant butterfly

Tell someone you them
There's always a way
And if the dead could speak
I know what they would say to you and me
Don′t waste another day

Show someone you love them
Don′t be scared to care
And if they fall into your arms
You'll be surprised to find
The weight that you can bear
Because

Life′s a miracle
Life's a miracle
Life′s a miracle
