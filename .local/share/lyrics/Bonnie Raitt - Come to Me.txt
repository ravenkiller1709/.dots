All I ever wanted was our love to be true
More than just enough to get me by
I want a love to see me throughI don′t need another well-spent night,
Another clever sideways glance
I wanna look my baby in the eye
And know there's nothing left to chance

Well if you′re tired of being lonely, beat up and confused
Darling, there's only one thing you can do:
Come to me
Don't be the one who′s waiting
Come to me
Babe, I got what you need
Wont you come to me
There won′t be no hesitating, babe
I know what you mean to me

I'm gonna hold out for no one
Ain′t gonna settle for less
'Cause the kind of love I′m looking for, baby,
You can't fake, you can′t finesse
I ain't looking for the kind of man, baby,
Who can't stand a little shaky ground
Who′ll give me fire and tenderness
And has got the guts to stick around

Well if you′re tired of being lonely, beat up and confused,
Darling, there's only one thing you can-
I got what you want, baby
Oh, and I got what you need
Well if you′re tired of being lonely, beat up and confused,
Darling there is only one thing you can do:
Come to me
Be the one who's waiting
Come to me
Ooh, I got what you need
Come to me
There won′t be no hesititing, babe
Won't you come to me
I got what you want now, baby
I got what you need
Won′t you come
Won't you bring it on home to me
Won't you come
Won′t you come on baby, bring it on home to me
Won′t you come to me
Bring all of your sweet love home
Won't you come to me
