Perhaps one day I'll love another
Whose eyes may be storm cloud grey
Whose every kiss is hot as summer
With the suns every ray

But no-one's ever, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal your thunder
Never, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal your thunder
Never, ever gonna steal your thunder

Of course, I might get lucky
And roll a six on the dice
There is a chance I'll be lucky
And see lightning strike twice

But no-one's ever, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal your thunder
Never, ever gonna steal
Ever gonna steal

No no (no no no no no no no no no no no no no)

No-one's ever, ever gonna steal, ever gonna steal your thunder
No-one's ever, ever gonna steal your thunder
