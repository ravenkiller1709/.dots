[Verse 1:]
If you're looking for Atlantis
You should cast your eye on me
Put your two and two together

Don't you know who built Atlantis
Then returned it to the sea
Don't you know who owns the weather
(Rain or shine)

Sure is good to seek a challenge
Sure is fine to set your sights
Sure is foolish to be blinded
There are legions out there churchin'
Searchin' for the holy grail
Isn't one of them can find it
(All this time)

[Chorus 1:]
You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
'Cause you'll never find Atlantis
'Til you make that someone me

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
'Cause you'll never find Atlantis
'Til you make that someone me

[Interlude:]
(Oh! Oh!)
(Oh! Oh!)

[Verse 2:]
Say you do find your volcano
And the darn thing is still hot
Lesson one, child don't waste it

Lesson two: The world's your cherry
But tomorrow, maybe not
Lesson three: Come on and taste it
(All this time)

[Chorus 2:]
You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
'Cause you'll never find Atlantis
'Til you make that someone me

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
'Cause you'll never find Atlantis
'Til you make that someone me

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
'Cause you'll never find Atlantis
'Til you make that someone me

You should be loving someone
And you know who it must be
'Cause you'll never find Atlantis
And I know
'Til you make that someone me

[Outro:]
'Til you make that someone me
