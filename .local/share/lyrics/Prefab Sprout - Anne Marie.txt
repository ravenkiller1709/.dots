There's a person that I'd like to be, Anne Marie
I can glimpse him when you're next to me, Anne Marie
There is music that no-one can hear, Anne Marie
Yet it's audible when you are near
Anne Marie, Anne Marie, what am I to do ?
You are married to someone else yet
Every waking hour I think of you
Oh listen to me Anne Marie
Anne Marie, Anne Marie, nothing much is new
I've a history of wanting what I cannot have
This time it is you
Don't listen to me Anne Marie
Anne Marie, there's a person that I'd like to be, Anne Marie
I can glimpse him when you're next to me, Anne Marie
There is music that no-one can hear, Anne Marie
Yet it's audible when you are near
Oh Anne Marie, this world's an unfamiliar place I see
When you're with me, when you're with me I hear
Strange music in undiscovered keys
When you're with me, when you're with me
Anne Marie, Anne Marie, it's time to walk away
I have never been noble but then maybe being
noble feels this way, when you're next to me Anne Marie
Anne Marie, and though it's time I can't believe
That I'm saying goodbye
Anne Marie - why ?
