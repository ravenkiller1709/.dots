Papa come quick, Jody′s gone to the city
What we gonna do now that Jody's gone
She left a note on the TV and Papa it′s a pityWhat we gonna do now that Jody's gone.

Mama's been cryin in the kitchen since mornin
She cried right through As The World Turns
I seen it myself and Papa it′s a bitch′n
Let's haul ass before the baby gets burned.

Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map
They got a head start about half a day
Load up the shotgun, put it in the gunrack
Jody′s with Chico down in East LA.

It must've been that wild-eyed, silver-tongued schemer
A girl like Jody don′t think for herself.
Him and that Harley and his damn Jalapena
Smokin that stuff'll make you hurt yourself.

Papa come quick
Papa come quick
Papa come quick
Papa come on.

(Repeat 1st verse)

Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map
They got a head start about a half a day
Stop at the Mobil, pump up the flat wheel
Jody & Chico and his ding dang deal.
