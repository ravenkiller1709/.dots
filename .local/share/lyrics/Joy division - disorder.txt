[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
Lose sensation, spare the insults, leave them for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away

[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, into no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow
[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell and who gives a damn right now?
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know

[Outro]
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling
